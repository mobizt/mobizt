![Mobizt's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mobizt&show_icons=true)

I'm engineer from Thailand.

I'm working on machine condition monitoring and vibration analysis.

The Industrial IoTs, data processing and data acquisition are the fields that I focused.

I develop and maintain the Arduino C++ opensource libraries for embedded devices.

One of my projects [Firebase Arduino Client Library for ESP8266 and ESP32](https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-ESP-Client) wins the [Google Open Source Peer Bonus Program](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/growing/peer-bonus).

The [E-mail client library for Arduino](https://github.com/mobizt/ESP-Mail-Client) project is the first E-mail client library in the Arduino platform that allows the embedded device to send and receive E-mail.

I'm ready to support and help for fixing the issues and answering the questions related to my libraries
